# reactWorkApp



### A simple app I wrote for work 
 it grabs information from a json file and displays who is on call for the week <br />
 with a timer and an upcomming month schedule and a responsive design <br />
This was my first react app I created. <br />


### BUGS
Has memory issues because of the countdown and react hooks - need more reading and testing to fix it.
